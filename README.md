Project Name
FitCRM – Simple Client Manager for a Fitness Program

Project Overview
FitCRM is a lightweight, frontend-only Client Relationship Management (CRM) web application designed specifically for fitness professionals (instructors, personal trainers, small gym owners). Its purpose is to provide an easy-to-use interface for managing basic client information and tracking their fitness goals without the complexity of a full-stack system.

Core Features (Current State - Assignment 1)
The project currently meets the requirements for a responsive, two-page static application using only HTML and CSS.

New Client Form (client-form.html)

A clean form layout using CSS Grid to collect essential client details: Full Name, Age, Gender, Email, Phone, Fitness Goal, and Membership Start Date.

The "Add Client" button is a placeholder and does not currently save or process data.

Client List View (client-list.html)

A responsive table displaying 10 sample clients with their Name, Email, Phone, Fitness Goal, and Membership Start Date.

Action buttons (Edit/Delete) are included as functional placeholders.

A search box is provided for fetching clients by name.

Responsive Design

The layout utilizes CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure optimal display on both desktop and mobile devices.

Non-critical table columns (Phone, Goal, Start Date) are hidden on mobile using media queries to maintain readability.
